# FPGA Audio Filtering with Verilog 🎵🔧  

A Verilog-based repository for implementing audio filtering on FPGA hardware. This project demonstrates how to process and filter audio signals using FPGA design principles.

---

## Features ✨  

- Implement low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filters.  
- Designed for real-time audio signal processing on FPGA.  
- Verilog modules for scalable and efficient design.  

---

## Getting Started 🚀  

### Prerequisites 🛠️  

- FPGA development board (e.g., Xilinx, Altera).  
- A Verilog-compatible simulator (e.g., ModelSim or Vivado).  
- Audio input and output peripherals (e.g., microphone, speaker).  

---

### Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fpga-audio-filter.git  
cd fpga-audio-filter  

2. Load the Verilog files into your FPGA development environment.  

3. Connect audio peripherals to your FPGA board for testing.

## Usage 🔧  

### Simulation  
Use your preferred Verilog simulator to test the filter modules:  
- Load the Verilog source files.  
- Run testbenches for the desired filter module (e.g., low-pass, high-pass).  

### Deployment  
1. Synthesize the Verilog design in your FPGA environment.  
2. Program the FPGA with the synthesized bitstream.  
3. Provide an audio signal input to the FPGA and monitor the filtered output.
